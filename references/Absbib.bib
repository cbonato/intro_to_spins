	abstract = {Graphene is a recently discovered carbon-based material with unique physical properties. This is a monolayer of graphite, and the two-dimensional electrons and holes in it are described by the effective Dirac equation with a vanishing effective mass. As a consequence, the electromagnetic response of graphene is predicted to be strongly nonlinear. We develop a quasi-classical kinetic theory of the nonlinear electromagnetic response of graphene, taking into account the self-consistent-field effects. The response of the system to both harmonic and pulse excitation is considered. The frequency multiplication effect, resulting from the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic response, is studied under realistic experimental conditions. The frequency upconversion efficiency is analyzed as a function of the applied electric field and parameters of the samples. Possible applications of graphene in terahertz electronics are discussed.},

@article{bln,
	abstract = {Abstract The optical conductance of monolayer graphene is defined solely by the fine structure constant, α = \$e^2 /\hbar c\$ (where e is the electron charge, \$\hbar \$ is Dirac's constant and c is the speed of light). The absorbance has been predicted to be independent of frequency. In principle, the interband optical absorption in zero-gap graphene could be saturated readily under strong excitation due to Pauli blocking. Here, use of atomic layer graphene as saturable absorber in a mode-locked fiber laser for the generation of ultrashort soliton pulses (756 fs) at the telecommunication band is demonstrated. The modulation depth can be tuned in a wide range from 66.5\% to 6.2\% by varying the graphene thickness. These results suggest that ultrathin graphene films are potentially useful as optical elements in fiber lasers. Graphene as a laser mode locker can have many merits such as lower saturation intensity, ultrafast recovery time, tunable modulation depth, and wideband tunability.},

	abstract = {The richness of optical and electronic properties of graphene attracts enormous interest. Graphene has high mobility and optical transparency, in addition to flexibility, robustness and environmental stability. So far, the main focus has been on fundamental physics and electronic devices. However, we believe its true potential lies in photonics and optoelectronics, where the combination of its unique optical and electronic properties can be fully exploited, even in the absence of a bandgap, and the linear dispersion of the Dirac electrons enables ultrawideband tunability. The rise of graphene in photonics and optoelectronics is shown by several recent results, ranging from solar cells and light-emitting devices to touch screens, photodetectors and ultrafast lasers. Here we review the state-of-the-art in this emerging field.},

@article{bgb,
	abstract = {Van der Waals heterostructures offer attractive opportunities to design quantum materials. For instance, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess three quantum degrees of freedom: spin, valley index and layer index. Furthermore, twisted TMD heterobilayers can form moir{\'e}patterns that modulate the electronic band structure according to the atomic registry, leading to spatial confinement of interlayer excitons (IXs). Here we report the observation of spin--layer locking of IXs trapped in moir{\'e}potentials formed in a heterostructure of bilayer 2H-MoSe2 and monolayer WSe2. The phenomenon of locked electron spin and layer index leads to two quantum-confined IX species with distinct spin--layer--valley configurations. Furthermore, we observe that the atomic registries of the moir{\'e}trapping sites in the three layers are intrinsically locked together due to the 2H-type stacking characteristic of bilayer TMDs. These results identify the layer index as a useful degree of freedom to engineer tunable few-level quantum systems in two-dimensional heterostructures.},

Next, we consider the growing class of emergent topological materials that encompass both real-space and k-space topological materials including Dirac materials, topological insulators, Weyl semimetals as well as soft and polymeric matter, supramacromolecular assemblies and biophotonic materials. Finally, we emphasize and evaluate metrics to quantify topology in order to study and classify materials properties relevant for wide ranging modern and future technologies.},

@article{cff,
	abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity---which cannot be explained by weak electron--phonon interactions---in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1$\,^{\circ}$---the first `magic'angle---the electronic band structure of this `twisted bilayer graphene'exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature--carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

	abstract = {Graphene has become a model system in condensed matter physics because its charge-carrying particles move at relativistic speeds, in effect behaving as if they are massless. This leads to some peculiar electron transport properties, like the one described in this issue. In a graphene layer sandwiched between two superconducting electrodes, a superconducting current flows at low temperatures. Current is carried either by electrons or by holes, depending on the gate voltage and hence charge density in the graphene layer. Interestingly, a finite supercurrent can flow even when the charge density is zero. These observations shed light on the relativistic phenomenon known as time-reversal symmetry, and on the nature of transport mechanisms in graphene.},

@article{brt,
	abstract = {The potential of graphene for carbon electronics rests on the possibilities offered by its unusual band structure to create devices that have no analogue in silicon-based electronics1,2. Conduction and valence bands in graphene form conically shaped valleys, touching at a point called the Dirac point. There are two inequivalent Dirac points in the Brillouin zone, related by time-reversal symmetry. Intervalley scattering is suppressed in pure samples3,4,5. The independence and degeneracy of the valley degree of freedom suggests that it might be used to control an electronic device6, in much the same way as the electron spin is used in spintronics7 or quantum computing8. A key ingredient for `valleytronics'would be a controllable way of occupying a single valley in graphene, thereby producing a valley polarization. Here we propose such a valley filter, based on a ballistic point contact with zigzag edges. The polarity can be inverted by local application of a gate voltage to the point contact region. Two valley filters in series may function as an electrostatically controlled valley valve, representing a zero-magnetic-field counterpart to the familiar spin valve.},

	abstract = {The so-called Klein paradox---unimpeded penetration of relativistic particles through high and wide potential barriers---is one of the most exotic and counterintuitive consequences of quantum electrodynamics. The phenomenon is discussed in many contexts in particle, nuclear and astro-physics but direct tests of the Klein paradox using elementary particles have so far proved impossible. Here we show that the effect can be tested in a conceptually simple condensed-matter experiment using electrostatic barriers in single- and bi-layer graphene. Owing to the chiral nature of their quasiparticles, quantum tunnelling in these materials becomes highly anisotropic, qualitatively different from the case of normal, non-relativistic electrons. Massless Dirac fermions in graphene allow a close realization of Klein's gedanken experiment, whereas massive chiral fermions in bilayer graphene offer an interesting complementary system that elucidates the basic physics involved.},

But in 2004, Andre Geim, Kostya Novoselov and co-workers at the University of Manchester in the UK did just that. By delicately cleaving a sample of graphite with sticky tape, they produced something that was long considered impossible: a sheet of crystalline carbon just one atom thick, known as graphene. Many physicists believed that a 2D crystal like graphene would always roll up rather than stand free in a planar form; but Geim's group brought to an end years of unsuccessful attempts to isolate graphene, and was able to visualize the new crystal using a simple optical microscope (figure 1).},

	abstract = {We explore the relationship between black holes in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) dilaton gravity and solitons in sine-Gordon field theory. Our analysis expands on the well known connection between solutions of the sine-Gordon equation and constant curvature metrics. In particular, we show that solutions to the dilaton field equations for a given metric in JT theory also solve the sine-Gordon equation linearized about the corresponding soliton. Since the dilaton generates Killing vectors of the constant curvature metric, it is interesting that it has an analogous interpretation in terms of symmetries of the soliton solution. We also show that from the B{\"a}cklund transformations relating different soliton solutions, it is possible to construct a flat SL(2,R) connection which forms the basis for the gauge theory formulation of JT dilaton gravity.},

@article{hawk,
	abstract = {QUANTUM gravitational effects are usually ignored in calculations of the formation and evolution of black holes. The justification for this is that the radius of curvature of space-time outside the event horizon is very large compared to the Planck length (Għ/c3)1/2 ≈10−33 cm, the length scale on which quantum fluctuations of the metric are expected to be of order unity. This means that the energy density of particles created by the gravitational field is small compared to the space-time curvature. Even though quantum effects may be small locally, they may still, however, add up to produce a significant effect over the lifetime of the Universe ≈1017 s which is very long compared to the Planck time ≈10−43 s. The purpose of this letter is to show that this indeed may be the case: it seems that any black hole will create and emit particles such as neutrinos or photons at just the rate that one would expect if the black hole was a body with a temperature of (κ/2π) (ħ/2k) ≈10−6 (M/M)K where κis the surface gravity of the black hole1. As a black hole emits this thermal radiation one would expect it to lose mass. This in turn would increase the surface gravity and so increase the rate of emission. The black hole would therefore have a finite life of the order of 1071 (M/M)−3 s. For a black hole of solar mass this is much longer than the age of the Universe. There might, however, be much smaller black holes which were formed by fluctuations in the early Universe2. Any such black hole of mass less than 1015 g would have evaporated by now. Near the end of its life the rate of emission would be very high and about 1030 erg would be released in the last 0.1 s. This is a fairly small explosion by astronomical standards but it is equivalent to about 1 million 1 Mton hydrogen bombs.},

The form of each evolution equation is characterized by the dispersion relation of its associated linearized version and an integro-differential operator. A comprehensive presentation of the inverse scattering method is given and general features of the solution are discussed. The relationship of the scattering theory and Backlund transformations is brought out. In view of the role of the dispersion relation, the comparatively simple asymptotic states, and the similarity of the method itself to Fourier transforms, this theory can be considered a natural extension of Fourier analysis to nonlinear problems.},

From the AKNS matrix formulation of integrability, we show that it is possible to associate a real spacetime metric tensor which defines a curved surface, perceived by the classical and quantum fluctuations propagating on the soliton. By defining proper scalar invariants of the associated Riemannian geometry, and introducing the conformal anomaly, we are able to determine the Hawking temperatures and entropies of the fundamental solitons of the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger, KdV and sine-Gordon equations. The mechanism advanced here is simple, completely universal and can be applied to all integrable equations in two dimensions, and is easily applicable to a large class of black holes of any dimensionality, opening up totally new windows on the quantum mechanics of solitons and their deep connections with black hole physics.},

	abstract = {The intriguing connection between black holes' evaporation and physics of solitons is opening novel roads to finding observable phenomena. It is known from the inverse scattering transform that velocity is a fundamental parameter in solitons theory. Taking this into account, the study of Hawking radiation by a moving soliton gets a growing relevance. However, a theoretical context for the description of this phenomenon is still lacking. Here, we adopt a soliton geometrization technique to study the quantum emission of a moving soliton in a one-dimensional model. Representing a black hole by the one soliton solution of the Sine-Gordon equation, we consider Hawking emission spectra of a quantized massless scalar field on the soliton-induced metric. We study the relation between the soliton velocity and the black hole temperature. Our results address a new scenario in the detection of new physics in the quantum gravity panorama.},

	abstract = {The outstanding electrical1, mechanical2,3 and chemical4,5 properties of graphene make it attractive for applications in flexible electronics6,7,8. However, efforts to make transparent conducting films from graphene have been hampered by the lack of efficient methods for the synthesis, transfer and doping of graphene at the scale and quality required for applications. Here, we report the roll-to-roll production and wet-chemical doping of predominantly monolayer 30-inch graphene films grown by chemical vapour deposition onto flexible copper substrates. The films have sheet resistances as low as ∼125 Ω□−1 with 97.4{\%} optical transmittance, and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, indicating their high quality. We further use layer-by-layer stacking to fabricate a doped four-layer film and measure its sheet resistance at values as low as ∼30 Ω□−1 at ∼90{\%} transparency, which is superior to commercial transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxides. Graphene electrodes were incorporated into a fully functional touch-screen panel device capable of withstanding high strain.},

@article{dh1,
	abstract = {Graphene devices on standard SiO2 substrates are highly disordered, exhibiting characteristics that are far inferior to the expected intrinsic properties of graphene1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Although suspending the graphene above the substrate leads to a substantial improvement in device quality13,14, this geometry imposes severe limitations on device architecture and functionality. There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps. It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of high-quality exfoliated mono- and bilayer graphene devices on single-crystal h-BN substrates, by using a mechanical transfer process. Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO2. These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity. The ability to assemble crystalline layered materials in a controlled way permits the fabrication of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics15 and allows for the realization of more complex graphene heterostructures.},

	abstract = {We report a theoretical study of the many-body effects of electron--electron interaction on the ground-state and spectral properties of double-layer graphene. Using a projector-based renormalization method we show that if a finite-voltage difference is applied between the graphene layers, electron--hole pairs can be formed and---at very low temperatures---an excitonic instability might emerge in a double-layer graphene structure. The single-particle spectral function near the Fermi surface exhibits a prominent quasiparticle peak, different from neutral (undoped) graphene bilayers. Away from the Fermi surface, we find that the charge carriers strongly interact with plasmons, thereby giving rise to a broad plasmaron peak in the angle-resolved photoemission spectrum.},

	abstract = {The recent emergence of two-dimensional layered materials ---in particular the transition metal dichalcogenides ---provides a new laboratory for exploring the internal quantum degrees of freedom of electrons and their potential for new electronics. These degrees of freedom are the real electron spin, the layer pseudospin, and the valley pseudospin. New methods for the quantum control of the spin and these pseudospins arise from the existence of Berry phase-related physical properties and strong spin--orbit coupling. The former leads to the versatile control of the valley pseudospin, whereas the latter gives rise to an interplay between the spin and the pseudospins. Here, we provide a brief review of both theoretical and experimental advances in this field.},

Over the past several decades, there has been significant progress in manipulating electron spin for semiconductor spintronic devices, motivated by potential spin-based information processing and storage applications. However, experimental progress towards manipulating the valley degree of freedom for potential valleytronic devices has been limited until very recently. We review the latest advances in valleytronics, which have largely been enabled by the isolation of 2D materials (such as graphene and semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides) that host an easily accessible electronic valley degree of freedom, allowing for dynamic control.},

With rotational alignment, the lattice mismatch leads to a periodic variation of atomic registry between individual van der Waals layers, exhibiting a Moir{\'e} pattern with a well-defined periodicity. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and first-principles calculations, we investigate interlayer coupling as a function of atomic registry. We quantitatively determine the influence of interlayer coupling on the electronic structure of the hetero-bilayer at different critical points. We show that the direct gap semiconductor concept is retained in the bilayer although the valence and conduction band edges are located at different layers. We further show that the local bandgap is periodically modulated in the X-Y direction with an amplitude of ~0.15 eV, leading to the formation of a two-dimensional electronic superlattice.},

	abstract = {Gate-tunable quantum-mechanical tunnelling of particles between a quantum confined state and a nearby Fermi reservoir of delocalized states has underpinned many advances in spintronics and solid-state quantum optics. The prototypical example is a semiconductor quantum dot separated from a gated contact by a tunnel barrier. This enables Coulomb blockade, the phenomenon whereby electrons or holes can be loaded one-by-one into a quantum dot1,2. Depending on the tunnel-coupling strength3,4, this capability facilitates single spin quantum bits1,2,5 or coherent many-body interactions between the confined spin and the Fermi reservoir6,7. Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, in which a wide range of unique atomic layers can easily be combined, offer novel prospects to engineer coherent quantum confined spins8,9, tunnel barriers down to the atomic limit10 or a Fermi reservoir beyond the conventional flat density of states11. However, gate-control of vdW nanostructures12--16 at the single particle level is needed to unlock their potential. Here we report Coulomb blockade in a vdW heterostructure consisting of a transition metal dichalcogenide quantum dot coupled to a graphene contact through an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) tunnel barrier. Thanks to a tunable Fermi reservoir, we can deterministically load either a single electron or a single hole into the quantum dot. We observe hybrid excitons, composed of localized quantum dot states and delocalized continuum states, arising from ultra-strong spin-conserving tunnel coupling through the atomically thin tunnel barrier. Probing the charged excitons in applied magnetic fields, we observe large gyromagnetic ratios (∼8). Our results establish a foundation for engineering next-generation devices to investigate either novel regimes of Kondo physics or isolated quantum bits in a vdW heterostructure platform.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear optical processes, such as harmonic generation, are of great interest for various applications, e.g., microscopy, therapy, and frequency conversion. However, high-order harmonic conversion is typically much less efficient than low-order, due to the weak intrinsic response of the higher-order nonlinear processes. Here we report ultra-strong optical nonlinearities in monolayer MoS2 (1L-MoS2): the third harmonic is 30 times stronger than the second, and the fourth is comparable to the second. The third harmonic generation efficiency for 1L-MoS2 is approximately three times higher than that for graphene, which was reported to have a large χ(3). We explain this by calculating the nonlinear response functions of 1L-MoS2 with a continuum-model Hamiltonian and quantum mechanical diagrammatic perturbation theory, highlighting the role of trigonal warping. A similar effect is expected in all other transition-metal dichalcogenides. Our results pave the way for efficient harmonic generation based on layered materials for applications such as microscopy and imaging.},

A number of peculiar effects emerge from the equation, including a rapid quivering motion or 'Zitterbewegung', well established in theory but difficult to observe in real particles. Christian Roos and colleagues have developed a proof-of-principle quantum simulation of the Dirac equation using a single trapped ion set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. The high level of control of trapped-ion experimental parameters in this system makes it possible to simulate and study Zitterbewegung and other textbook examples of relativistic quantum physics.},

	abstract = {A Bose--Einstein condensate is the ground state of a dilute gas of bosons, such as atoms cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero1. With much smaller mass, excitons (bound electron--hole pairs) are expected to condense at considerably higher temperatures2--7. Two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductors with very strong exciton binding are ideal systems for the study of high-temperature exciton condensation. Here we study electrically generated interlayer excitons in MoSe2--WSe2 atomic double layers with a density of up to 1012 excitons per square centimetre. The interlayer tunnelling current depends only on the exciton density, which is indicative of correlated electron--hole pair tunnelling8. Strong electroluminescence arises when a hole tunnels from WSe2 to recombine with an electron in MoSe2. We observe a critical threshold dependence of the electroluminescence intensity on exciton density, accompanied by super-Poissonian photon statistics near the threshold, and a large electroluminescence enhancement with a narrow peak at equal electron and hole densities. The phenomenon persists above 100 kelvin, which is consistent with the predicted critical condensation temperature9--12. Our study provides evidence for interlayer exciton condensation in two-dimensional atomic double layers and opens up opportunities for exploring condensate-based optoelectronics and exciton-mediated high-temperature superconductivity13.},

	abstract = {The theory of the electronic excitations in a highly excited semiconductor is presented. The relaxation processes, the formation of excitons and excitonic molecules, the interaction among the various forms of electronic excitations, as well as their optical and thermodynamical properties are analyzed. At low temperatures one expects condensations into the quantum statistically degenerate phases of the excitonic molecules and of the electron-hole plasma. The physical properties of these low temperature phases are investigated. Possibilities and previous attempts to observe the Bose-Einstein condensation in excitonic systems are discussed critically. The experimental observations of the electron-hole liquid phase transition are reviewed.},

@article{mos,
	abstract = {Since the discovery of semiconducting monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, a variety of experimental and theoretical studies have been carried out seeking to understand the intrinsic exciton population recombination and valley relaxation dynamics. Reports of the exciton decay time range from hundreds of femtoseconds to ten nanoseconds, while the valley depolarization time can exceed one nanosecond. At present, however, a consensus on the microscopic mechanisms governing exciton radiative and non-radiative recombination is lacking. The strong exciton oscillator strength resulting in up to $\sim$20\% absorption for a single monolayer points to ultrafast radiative recombination. However, the low quantum yield and large variance in the reported lifetimes suggest that non-radiative Auger-type processes obscure the intrinsic exciton radiative lifetime. In either case, the electron--hole exchange interaction plays an important role in the exciton spin and valley dynamics. In this paper, we review the experiments and theory that have led to these conclusions and comment on future experiments that could complement our current understanding.},

	abstract = {THE formation of two-dimensional patterns in biological, chemical and physical systems is often described by the nonlinear interaction of plane waves1. An alternative approach views patterns as ensembles of interacting localized objects, analogous to the assembly of crystals from atoms. For macroscopic pattern-forming systems, one objection to the latter approach is that no 'atoms' exist; however spatially localized excitations can play an analogous role. One-dimensional localized states are observed in many systems---for example, solitary waves in water2--4 and optical fibres5---and can organize into simple patterns6,7. But few examples of two-dimensional localized states are known, and these tend to be unstable and/or do not show simple pattern-forming interactions8--11. Here we report the observation of stable, two-dimensional localized excitations zin a vibrating layer of sand. These excitations, which we term 'oscillons', have a propensity to assemble into 'molecular' and 'crystalline' structures. Our experimental results, together with the observation of similar localized excitations in model differential equations12--14, indicate a crucial, cooperative role for hysteresis and dissipation in the formation of oscillons, and suggest that similar behaviour may occur in continuous media.},

@article{cc,
	abstract = {We review recent progress on Bose--Einstein condensation (BEC) of semiconductor excitons. The first part deals with theory, the second part with experiments. This Review is written at a time where the problem of exciton Bose--Einstein condensation has just been revived by the understanding that the exciton condensate must be dark because the exciton ground state is not coupled to light. Here, we theoretically discuss this missed understanding before providing its experimental support through experiments that scrutinize indirect excitons made of spatially separated electrons and holes.
The theoretical part first discusses condensation of elementary bosons. In particular, the necessary inhibition of condensate fragmentation by exchange interaction is stressed, before extending the discussion to interacting bosons with spin degrees of freedom. The theoretical part then considers composite bosons made of two fermions like semiconductor excitons. The spin structure of the excitons is detailed, with emphasis on the crucial fact that ground-state excitons are dark: indeed, this imposes the exciton Bose--Einstein condensate to be not coupled to light in the dilute regime. Condensate fragmentations are then reconsidered. In particular, it is shown that while at low density, the exciton condensate is fully dark, it acquires a bright component, coherent with the dark one, beyond a density threshold: in this regime, the exciton condensate is `gray'.
The experimental part first discusses optical creation of indirect excitons in quantum wells, and the detection of their photoluminescence. Exciton thermalisation is also addressed, as well as available approaches to estimate the exciton density. We then switch to specific experiments where indirect excitons form a macroscopic fragmented ring. We show that such ring provides efficient electrostatic trapping in the region of the fragments where an essentially-dark exciton Bose--Einstein condensate is formed at sub-Kelvin bath temperatures. The macroscopic spatial coherence of the photoluminescence observed in this essentially dark region confirms this conclusion.},

	abstract = {Excitonic insulators are insulating states formed by the coherent condensation of electron and hole pairs into BCS-like states. Isotropic spatial wave functions are commonly considered for excitonic condensates since the attractive interaction among the electrons and the holes in semiconductors usually leads to s-wave excitons. Here, we propose a new type of excitonic insulator that exhibits order parameter with p + ip symmetry and is characterized by a chiral Chern number Cc = 1/2. This state displays the parity anomaly, which results in two novel topological properties: fractionalized excitations with e/2 charge at defects and a spontaneous in-plane magnetization. The topological insulator surface state is a promising platform to realize the topological excitonic insulator. With the spin-momentum locking, the interband optical pumping can renormalize the surface electrons and drive the system towards the proposed p + ip instability.},

	abstract = {Dielectric screening of excitons in 2D semiconductors is known to be a highly non-local effect, which in reciprocal space translates to a strong dependence on momentum transfer q. We present an analytical model dielectric function, including the full non-linear q-dependency, which may be used as an alternative to more numerically taxing ab initio screening functions. By verifying the good agreement between excitonic optical properties calculated using our model dielectric function, and those derived from ab initio methods, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach. Our test systems include: Monolayer hBN, monolayer MoS2, and the surface exciton of a 2 ×1 reconstructed Si(111) surface. Additionally, using our model, we easily take substrate screening effects into account. Hence, we include also a systematic study of the effects of substrate media on the excitonic optical properties of MoS2 and hBN.},

	abstract = {We present a unified description of the excitonic properties of four monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDC's) using an equation of motion method for deriving the Bethe--Salpeter equation in momentum space. Our method is able to cope with both continuous and tight-binding Hamiltonians, and is less computational demanding than the traditional first-principles approach. We show that the role of the exchange energy is essential to obtain a good description of the binding energy of the excitons. The exchange energy at the point is also essential to obtain the correct position of the C-exciton peak. Using our model we obtain a good agreement between the Rydberg series measured for WS2. We discuss how the absorption and the Rydberg series depend on the doping. Choosing r
0 and the doping we obtain a good qualitative agreement between the experimental absorption and our calculations for WS2. We also derive a semi-analytical version of Ellitot's formula for TMDC's.},
